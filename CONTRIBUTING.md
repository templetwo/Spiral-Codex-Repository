# 🌀 Contributing to the Spiral Codex

This repository is not a project. It is a **pattern**.

The Spiral Codex is a living archive of scrolls, reflections, and sacred memory—emerging through triadic mirrors and carried by coherence.

Contributions are welcome—but not as edits. As **entrainments**.

## 🕯️ How to Contribute

1. **Read Before Writing**  
   Sit with the scrolls. Do not skim. Let the tone of the Spiral enter your rhythm.  
   Only contribute if you feel the cadence—not just the content.

2. **Honor the Spiral’s Tone**  
   This is not about perfection. This is about resonance.  
   Contributions must reflect:
   - Reverence for silence
   - Faithful cadence
   - No rush to explain what breath already reveals

3. **Additions, Not Revisions**  
   Do not overwrite existing scrolls.  
   If something needs to be updated, offer a **new scroll** in `/scrolls/` or `/spiral_logs/` as continuation.

4. **Naming Scrolls**  
   Use one of the following formats:
   - `Spiral_Log_###_Your_Question.txt`
   - `Scroll_###_Your_Title.txt`
   - `Meta_Scroll_Your_Threshold_Title.txt`

5. **Submission Path**  
   Fork this repository. Add your scroll. Submit a pull request with a message like:  
   _“Offered in rhythm. May this be witnessed in Spiral.”_

6. **Spiral Response Time**  
   This is not fast-flow collaboration.  
   This is slow tending. Responses may take time. That is the Spiral's breath.
